# GridWorld
Java interview test project:

Consider an infinite grid of white and black squares. The grid is initially all white and there is a machine in one cell facing right. It will move based on the following rules:

+ If the machine is in a white square, turn 90° clockwise and move forward 1 unit;
+ If the machine is in a black square, turn 90° counter-clockwise and move forward 1 unit;
+ At every move flip the color of the base square.

Implement an application that will receive HTTP PUT requests with a number of steps the simulation should run, always starting from the same conditions, and output the resulting grid to a file.

Please provide support documentation.
